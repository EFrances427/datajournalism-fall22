I had several problems with these data sets because the ones provided were not separated by county. First, counties are reported twice for each individual Apache tribe. Second, there are five counties that are apparently wrong, which makes me think it is because Datawrapper does not have USA counties for 2020. I started combining counties with the same GEO IDs and realized it would take a long time to get through the list of the reported Apache population for 2020 since there are many variations. If I had more time, I would combine the ones with the same GEO IDs (I'm sure there was a faster way for me to do it rather than manually summing up) so it could show the data properly.
