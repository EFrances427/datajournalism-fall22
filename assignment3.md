Original dataset: https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/rates.html Homeownership rates for the 75 largest metropolitan statistical areas, 2015 to present
To clean this data, I first made six new pages isolating the homeownership rates for these places by year, and I cleaned 2018-2023. Then, I created a five-year span spreadsheet, and lastly I copied that page and added the average homeownership rate per city per year based on the quarterly data available. These steps were tedious and there were probably faster ways to do them, this was a bit challenging and I had a tough time figuring out what isolate and clean and what to leave alone.
With the pivot tables, I first wanted to examine how D.C. homeownership has changed from 2018 to 2022. I took the averages from each year and displayed them next to each other, and the data shows small fluctuations between years -- nothing newsworthy. I then tried to see what statistical area had the highest percent of homeownership, but I was unable to sort the pivot table for some reason (I'd love for you to take a look! It may not be possible). I think looking at where homeownership has grown can lead to the answer to why working wages can afford homes in one area versus another, I'd really like to look deeper into that.
