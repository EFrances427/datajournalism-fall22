Organizations have reported on Americans, young people specifically, and their inability to secure housing for different reasons. We found articles localized to different places, such as Washington, D.C. and other busy regions. To differ from these, we were thinking about comparing D.C.’s home affordability and income dynamics to other cities similar in population and age. If we used a couple of cities and compared them, it could show patterns and reveal more information about why people with living wages still cannot afford permanent housing.

## Datasets:

Median income in different cities (by amount in the household):
https://www.justice.gov/ust/eo/bapcpa/20220401/bci_data/median_income_table.htm
This data is from the Department of Justice, making it seemingly reliable for a data source. A limitation might be there are no overall averages for the states, and we might need the average instead the average for each amount of people in a household. That could be limiting regarding what data we’re trying to compare to.

Median housing prices:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?eid=1138280&rid=462 – this is by square foot in certain metropolitan areas
https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/27290
This data should be accurate because it is from the Economic Reserve Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. They have individual profiles for every state that include data related to demographics, housing prices and an all-transactions house price index, which would be very helpful to our project. I think these datasets will not be limiting and will instead be helpful to compare between states.

Homeownership by state:
https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/rates.html
This data is from the U.S. census, meaning it will be a reliable source of data. This data may be limiting because of the confusing way the Excel spreadsheet is set up, but I am sure we could figure out how to interpret that data into something we can work with.
